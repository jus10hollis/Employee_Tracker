## Issues

Still needs to be pre-populated with seeds.sql. Error indicates it doesn't like how my id is. Not sure why. It's exactly like the in-class activities. Inquirer prompt options still need to be sorted out and [IMPORTANTLY] I need to figure out how to respond to user input from command-line. 'Payloads' or whatever you call them are still a bit of a mystery. req.body, right? I know this still needs work. Just getting something up for now.
